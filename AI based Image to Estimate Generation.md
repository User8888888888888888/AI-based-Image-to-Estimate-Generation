<h3 align="center">AI Driven Estimate Generation & Car Damage Assessment</h3>

Building a car damage assessment and estimate generation follows Image → CV Model → Damage Detection + Severity → Mapping to Repair Action → CostLookup or ML Estimate → Total Estimate Generation. We will use **EfficientNetB0** model for damage assessment and **XGBRegressor** model for estimate generation. This AI-powered approach will optimize estimating precision, reduce claim processing time, and drive cost efficiency for insurers, repair facilities, and vehicle owners ensuring smarter, faster, and more reliable with auto generated claims estimates integrated within insurance workflow.
